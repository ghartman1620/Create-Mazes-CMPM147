This a repository containing the assets associated with Gabe Hartman's CMPM 147 Project 3: Generating Space. Instructor Jo Mazeika.

Currently my project generates maze-like indoor spaces using Unity.

It can be navigated using a top-down view rolling ball controlled with WASD.

Currently no build is in this repo.
