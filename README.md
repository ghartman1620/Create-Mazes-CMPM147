This a repository containing the assets associated with Gabe Hartman's CMPM 147 Project 3: Generating Space. Instructor Jo Mazeika.

Created with unity.

It creates indoor spaces containing maze structures and key/lock puzzles like https://imgur.com/a/fUZ3Fmn.

It accomplishes this with a graph grammar for the mission structure of the level and use of graphs to generate the spaces the mission occupies.

It can be navigated using a top-down view rolling ball controlled with WASD.

A build can be found in the target directory or the compressed target.zip. Build has been tested succesfully on windows 10, I'm not sure about other operating systems.

I've included what seems to me to be the parts of the project that aren't linked libraries, but if anybody tries cloning this and is unable to run it in their own unity editor let me know what's missing.
